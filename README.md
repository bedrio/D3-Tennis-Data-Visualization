**Implemented and in Progress:**
We have implemented our What are their strengths Pie chart which is an interactive Pie Chart that helps demonstrate the different strengths of the big 3. The HTML elements that interact with the Pie Chart have been implemented. We also preprocessed the data for our big showpiece Bar Chart Race. 

**Features to be completed:**
- The placeholder texts for each player with a cutout picture of them
- A chart for each player that accompanies their description and image
- The bar chart race at the bottom.
- Design and layout in general.

**Chart 1: Slam/Surface Pie Chart**
This now has two interactive features, you can select between the big 3 as well as select whether you want to see their Slam split, or their surface split for their many titles. This gives a good idea of how dramatically they differ from one another, but also how, together they basically block out the entire competition. Features to be added: highlight slice when hovering over it, add dynamic legend, change colors, add animation to transition, and improve layout of buttons and design.

**Changes in Plan:**
We made some pretty big structural changes to our rough plan as we fleshed it out to tell the story more fluidly.Our plan now starts with a basic about me, followed by a depiction of their unique strengths, charts that demonstrate how they dominated different eras and fields of the game and finally our Bar Chart Race. We redesigned our pie chart from year to surface of courts to give a more complete picture of the Big 3 Tennis dynamic.
Data Preprocessing: Our datasets for the first two charts were hand crafted by going over information over the internet as well as the personal memory of one of our members.
